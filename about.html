                    <p>I've been working at the Rutgers ECE Department Since September 2015, the first month of my freshman year! Some of the things I do include: making flyers to promote events hosted by our department,
                       create excel sheets to organize information, and help organize travel business reports.</p>
                    <p>There are a lot of reasons I enjoy working at the ECE Department, but the most important reason would be the people.
                      My supervisor is an amazing person and one of the best bosses you could ask for. She's humourous, kind, and understanding.
                      She always encourages me to go to career fairs, do extracurricular events, and talk to professors in my department to aid with my studies.
                      Aside from my supervisor, my coworkers are no less amazing! They always treat me with nothing but love and kindness and they always manage
                    to put a smile on my face no matter what kind of a day I'm having! As a frehman, I made my first friends of my major at my workplace. To this day
                  they continue to be my best friends as we always have each others back as we try to survive Engineering! </p>
                    <p>Overall, my job gives me great experience on working at a professional office. Although I am given many challenges weekly, I try my best <tbody>
                      overcome them by working with my coworkers and using critical thinking.

                            <p>To give a little bit of background about this club: it's a student run club where we offer block based coding workshops
                            to students who come to us with little to knowledge of coding. Our goal essentially is to expose students to coding and increase
                          their knowledge from Novice to Expert levels!</p>
                            <p>The N2E Coding Club just started off Spring of 2016, and I am one of the lucky people to have been with this club since the very begining.
                            I was initially attracted to this club because I love coding and I wanted to get everyone else as excited as I am about it! I joined the board
                          as the workshop coordinator, and my job is to facilitate the coding workshops by finding instructors to teach them, getting the students to sign up for the right classses, booking
                        rooms where the workshops can be taught, etc.</p>
                            <p>Aside from being a board memeber, I also teach python with N2E Coding Club. Python was the first coding language I created a project with
                            , so I find it such a great starter language and I hope I can introduce my students to it well enough for them to create projects on their own someday too!</p>

                                                <p>BSA is a student run organization dedicated to celebrating the Bengali culture. Aside from our Bengali themed general meetings,
                                                we have big events every year where we showcase our culture with music, food, performances, and more. Joining BSA in my freshman year
                                              was one of the best decisions I made in college! While I was antisocial in the first couple of meetings, the board members invited me in
                                            as one of there own and made me feel at home. I was able to meet many people that share the same love for Bangladesh as me and I made
                                          many irreplaceable friends. As I became more involved with the club, I was also encouraged to act in play for the Bengali New Years! Although
                                        I was very scared at first, with the help of my friends, I was able to break out of my shell and perform in front of hundreds of poeple. </p>
                                                <p>This year I joined the BSA Board and became the Technology Chair. My work involves creating flyers and presentations to promote our general meetings
                                                and big events. I also oversee all technical aspects of our events. I really enjoy being a part of the board that puts together such fun
                                              activitiesand I hope to try my hardest to make all our events very successful!</p>
